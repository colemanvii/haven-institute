# LEXICON — Creative Physics

This lexicon gives shared, human language to inner experience.
These words are tools, not ideology.

If language clarifies, keep it.
If it distorts, discard it.

## Core Terms

### Wattage
The inner voltage of a person when aligned.
Clear attention, emotional coherence, and embodied presence flowing together.

High wattage feels calm, steady, and inevitable — not frantic.

---

### Radiant Heat
A person’s creative signature.
Not explosive fire, but steady warmth over time.

Radiant heat endures.

---

### Ember
The smallest living unit of creative fire.
Protected, not displayed.

The work is to keep it alive.

---

### Tending
The practice of protecting wattage over time.
Includes rest, pacing, limits, and restraint.

Tending prevents burnout, distortion, and spectacle.

---

### Aligned Fire
Focused intensity without chaos.
Wattage + purpose + presence moving in one direction.

Power that burns clean.

---

### Creative Pressure
Accumulated feeling, meaning, and intuition.
Pressure is not stress — it is stored significance.

If not expressed, it leaks.
If rushed, it distorts.

---

### Ignition
The moment pressure becomes direction.
Nervous system leans forward.
Action becomes possible.

---

### Glide
The open, spacious state after ignition.
Tension drops.
Perception widens.
Insight moves freely.

---

### Ignition → Glide → Create
The natural rhythm of clean creativity.
Skipping glide leads to force.
Skipping ignition leads to drift.

---

### Solune
The soft inner glow that appears when alignment is correct.
Deeper than calm.
Steadier than excitement.

A signal of rightness.

---

### Signal
What is true, alive, and essential.
Signal is felt before it is named.

---

### Spectacle
Output that prioritizes attention over truth.
Spectacle drains wattage.

Haven protects signal.

---

### Wholeness
No inner split.
Feeling, meaning, and action tell the same story.

The foundation of all creative work.

---

## Closing Note

These terms will evolve.
They are alive only if they remain useful.

Language creates perception.
Perception shapes behavior.
Behavior becomes destiny.
