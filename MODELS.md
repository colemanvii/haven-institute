# MODELS — Creative Physics

These models are **orientation tools**.
They are not claims of truth — they are ways of seeing.

If a model reduces confusion, it works.
If it adds confusion, discard it.

## Model 1: The Three-System Alignment

Creativity stabilizes when three systems align:

1. **Feeling**  
   Emotion, care, intuition, signal  
   (primarily limbic + interoceptive systems)

2. **Meaning**  
   Language, framing, judgment, restraint  
   (primarily prefrontal systems)

3. **Motion**  
   Action, speech, making, movement  
   (primarily motor systems)

Misalignment creates distortion:
- Feeling without meaning → overwhelm
- Meaning without motion → stagnation
- Motion without feeling → emptiness

## Model 2: The 7-Area Brain Map (Functional)

This is a practical, human-scale map.

1. **Brainstem** — safety, breath, baseline regulation  
2. **Cerebellum** — timing, rhythm, smoothness  
3. **Limbic system** — emotion, memory, attachment  
4. **Basal ganglia** — habit, initiation, momentum  
5. **Sensory cortex** — noticing, input, body sense  
6. **Motor cortex** — readiness, intention, action  
7. **Prefrontal cortex** — meaning, language, restraint  

Creative clarity emerges when:
- limbic (care),
- prefrontal (meaning),
- motor (action)

are synchronized.

## Model 3: Ignition → Glide → Create

A natural creative rhythm:

1. **Ignition**  
   Direction forms.
   Pressure becomes movement.

2. **Glide**  
   Spaciousness opens.
   Insight flows.
   Effort drops.

3. **Create**  
   Form appears.
   Action completes.

Skipping steps causes distortion.

## Model 4: Wattage Protection

High-quality work requires wattage protection.

Threats:
- urgency without meaning
- constant stimulation
- performative output
- identity tied to scale

Protections:
- rest
- pacing
- limits
- solitude
- place-based grounding

## Model 5: Tending vs Forcing

**Forcing**
- accelerates output
- ignores nervous system
- drains ember

**Tending**
- preserves signal
- allows endurance
- compounds over time
