# Haven Institute

Haven Institute is a practical research studio for **inner experience**:
how attention, emotion, meaning, and action synchronize in real time.

We build **Creative Physics** — a simple, human language for:
- what you feel inside
- how the nervous system shifts gears
- how creativity moves from signal → form
- how to protect the ember (wattage) without turning life into performance

## The Core Idea

**Creative clarity** happens when three systems align:
1) **Feeling** (what matters)
2) **Meaning** (what it means)
3) **Motion** (what you do next)

When they sync, you get: calm power, clean direction, honest work.

## The 7-Area Brain Map (basic)

This is our working map (functional, not academic):
1. Brainstem — safety / breath
2. Cerebellum — timing / rhythm
3. Limbic — emotion / memory / attachment
4. Basal ganglia — habit / initiation
5. Sensory cortex — noticing / input
6. Motor cortex — readiness / action
7. Prefrontal cortex — meaning / language / restraint

## Creative Physics Lexicon (starter)

- **Wattage**: inner voltage when aligned  
- **Radiant heat**: steady signature warmth (not spectacle)  
- **Aligned fire**: focused intensity without chaos  
- **Ignition → Glide → Create**: the clean rhythm of making  
- **Solune**: the soft glow of rightness at the center  
- **Tending**: the practice of protecting the ember over time  

## What We’re Building

- A simple curriculum anyone can use (artists, founders, humans)
- Field notes, diagrams, and “chalkboard” maps
- A clean repository of language, models, and practices
- A bridge between neuroscience, contemplative science, and lived craft

## How to Use This Repo

Start here:
- `docs/START-HERE.md` — orientation + the one-minute explanation
- `docs/LEXICON.md` — living glossary
- `docs/MODELS.md` — the core frameworks
- `docs/PRACTICES.md` — daily/weekly protocols
- `docs/READING.md` — sources + influences

## Influences (living list)

Socrates → wholeness  
Plato → breadth  
Aristotle → telos (purpose)  
Wendell Berry → tending (endurance in place)

Modern research we learn from (not endorsements):
- Affective neuroscience / emotion construction
- Contemplative neuroscience
- Attention + interoception research
- Habits, action selection, motivation

## Status

This is an early public notebook.  
**Signal over spectacle.**  
We ship small, true pieces.
