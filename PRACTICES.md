# PRACTICES — Creative Physics

These practices are simple.
They are meant to be used, not admired.

Nothing here requires discipline.
Only attention and honesty.

---

## Daily Practice (10–30 minutes)

### 1. Settle the System (2–5 min)
- Slow breath
- Feel the body
- Let urgency drain

Question:
> “Am I safe enough to tell the truth?”

---

### 2. Check the Three Systems (3–5 min)

Ask, without fixing:

- **Feeling** — What do I care about right now?
- **Meaning** — What does this moment ask of me?
- **Motion** — What is the smallest true next act?

If one is missing, don’t force it.
Wait.

---

### 3. One Clean Act (5–20 min)

Do **one** thing:
- draw
- write
- walk
- speak
- make

Stop before depletion.
Leave heat in the ember.

---

## Weekly Practice (30–60 minutes)

### 1. Review Without Judgment
Look back and notice:
- where wattage increased
- where it leaked
- where you rushed
- where you tended well

No correction yet.
Just pattern recognition.

---

### 2. Re-center on Signal

Ask:
> “What is trying to live through me right now?”

Name it simply.
One sentence is enough.

---

### 3. Adjust Pace, Not Ambition

Do not add more.
Remove friction.

Endurance beats intensity.

---

## The Stop Rule

When you notice:
- irritability
- performative thinking
- urgency without clarity
- loss of care

**Stop.**

Rest protects wattage.
Stopping early keeps the ember alive.

---

## Place-Based Practice

Whenever possible:
- work in the same chair
- walk the same ground
- return to familiar light

Place stabilizes meaning.

---

## Night Closure (2 minutes)

Before sleep, say (out loud or inward):

> “The ember is safe.  
> Nothing essential is lost.  
> I can rest.”

Then stop thinking.

---

## Closing Note

This is not optimization.
It is stewardship.

Tend long enough,
and the work knows what to do.
