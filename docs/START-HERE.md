# START HERE — Haven Institute

Haven Institute exists to give **clear, human language** to inner experience,
so creativity can move without distortion.

This is not theory-first.
It is **felt → named → practiced**.

## The One-Minute Explanation

Creativity breaks when:
- the body feels unsafe,
- emotion has no language,
- meaning floats without action,
- action happens without care.

Creativity flows when:
- the nervous system is settled,
- feeling, meaning, and motion align,
- work moves at the speed it can endure.

We call this **Creative Physics**.

## The Core Alignment

Three systems must sync:

1. **Feeling** — what matters (emotion, care, signal)
2. **Meaning** — what it means (language, framing, restraint)
3. **Motion** — what happens next (speech, movement, making)

When these align:
- pressure releases
- clarity appears
- action becomes clean

## What “Tending” Means Here

We do not optimize for output.
We **tend the ember** so output remains true.

Tending means:
- protecting attention
- pacing work
- grounding ideas in place, body, and time
- stopping before distortion sets in

## How to Use This Repository

Read in this order:
1. `START-HERE.md` (you are here)
2. `LEXICON.md` — shared language
3. `MODELS.md` — simple maps
4. `PRACTICES.md` — daily/weekly use

Take what works.
Leave what doesn’t.
Nothing here requires belief — only attention.

## Orientation Statement

> Wholeness before scale.  
> Signal before spectacle.  
> Endurance over intensity.  
> Tending is the work.
